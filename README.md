# Reservation-System-for-Courses

# Project Overview

This project focuses on testing the Reservation Software, a reservation management system developed in C. The software handles user and admin functionalities, ensuring seamless reservation processes. The testing process follows structured methodologies to validate functionality, security, and performance, ensuring reliability and robustness.

# Testing Approach

A structured approach was taken to ensure complete test coverage:

# Unit Testing:

Implemented using the CUnit framework to validate individual functions and modules.

# Functional Testing:

Verified all user interactions, including reservation creation, modification, and deletion.

# Security Testing:

Ensured proper access controls, data protection, and system integrity.

# Coverage Analysis:

Applied MC/DC (Modified Condition/Decision Coverage), boundary value analysis, and state transition testing to achieve comprehensive validation.

# Deliverables

1- A detailed test report documenting test cases, execution results, and detected issues.
2- Bug reports and recommendations for software improvement.
3- Code coverage analysis and validation using industry-standard testing techniques.

# How to Run Tests
1- Navigate to the project directory.
2- Install dependencies and the CUnit framework.
3- Run the test suite using the provided test script.
4- Analyze test results and logs to identify potential failures.
